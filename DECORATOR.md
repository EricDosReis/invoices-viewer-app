# Decorator

The Decorator pattern extends (decorates) an object’s behavior dynamically. The ability to add new behavior at runtime is accomplished by a Decorator object which ‘wraps itself’ around the original object. Multiple decorators can add or override functionality to the original object.

## Running examples

1. clone this repository
2. run ```node server``` on terminal
3. access in your browser http://localhost:3000/decorators.html
4. open console tab in your browser to see decorators working
